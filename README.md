I developed a Python script that extracts email addresses and phone numbers from web pages based on user input. The script starts by greeting the user warmly and then prompts them to enter one or more URLs. After receiving the URLs, it sends HTTP GET requests to fetch the content of each page. I designed the script to parse the retrieved content using BeautifulSoup and extract relevant data through regular expressions.

I implemented functionality to handle cases where no emails or phone numbers are found, ensuring the results are displayed clearly in a table. This table is formatted with the `tabulate` library to present each URL along with the found phone numbers and email addresses. To make the results easily accessible, I included a feature that saves the data to a CSV file named `results.csv`. The script then provides a downloadable link to this file, allowing users to easily download and review their extracted data. This solution combines immediate visual feedback with the convenience of downloadable records for thorough data analysis and management.
